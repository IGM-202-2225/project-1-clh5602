### Student Info

-   Name: Colby Heaton
-   Section: ##202.01

## Game Design

-   Camera Orientation: Side
-   Camera Movement: Camera will be fixed.
-   Player Health: Lives. Once lives are out, game over!
-   End Condition: A round ends once all enemies on the map are defeated.
-   Scoring: The player earns points by defeating enemies. A combo meter will increase the amount of points gained.

### Game Description

Gameplay will by similar to that of _Defender_, in the sense that levels will be looping arenas where you must defeat each enemy to progress.
The player can fly around the looping terrain while utilizing two different types of projectiles to clear waves of foes. Players will aim for a high-score
by defeating enemies at a rapid pace. A time bonus will be awarded for each level based on how fast it was cleared, and a combo system encourages players
to act fast and reckless in order to capitalize on the point bonus.

### Controls

-   Movement
    -   Up: up arrow, increase altitude
    -   Down: down arrow, decrease altitude
    -   Left: left arrow, turn left, increase leftward speed
    -   Right: right arrow, turn right, increase rightward speed
-   Fire: Z Key fires forward shots, and X Key drops projectiles towards the ground.

## You Additions

The combo system will be interesting to implement. Having a combo meter incentivizes fast play, so I might change up how the health system works. Instead of losing lives, maybe the player will have a time limit each level, and will lose time when they get hit? Other than that, I plan to have at least two enemy types and two types of projectiles. I would also like to add some sort of map, so players won't need to wander the entire map to find the last few enemies.
