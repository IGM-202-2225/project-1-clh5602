-   End Condition: A round ends once all enemies on the map are defeated.

### Game Description

Gameplay will by similar to that of _Defender_, in the sense that levels will be looping arenas where you must defeat each enemy to progress.
The player can fly around the looping terrain while utilizing two different types of projectiles to clear waves of foes. Players will aim for a high-score
by defeating enemies at a rapid pace. A time bonus will be awarded for each level based on how fast it was cleared, and a combo system encourages players
to act fast and reckless in order to capitalize on the point bonus.

### Controls

    -   Up: up arrow, increase altitude
    -   Down: down arrow, decrease altitude
    -   Left: left arrow, turn left, increase leftward speed
    -   Right: right arrow, turn right, increase rightward speed
-   Fire: Z Key fires forward shots, and X Key drops projectiles towards the ground.
